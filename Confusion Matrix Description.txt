The confusion matrix heatmap shows:

True Positives (TP): correctly predicted positives

True Negatives (TN): correctly predicted negatives

False Positives (FP): predicted positive, but actually negative

False Negatives (FN): predicted negative, but actually positive

This helps you assess how well the model distinguishes between disease presence and absence.
